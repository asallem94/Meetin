We can also meet at the Captain's Table down the street (they allow dogs on their patio!) for some food and drink afterward.”</p>
          <p>“Let's get together for affordable activities in our neighborhood, like going to storytime at the library, having picnics at McCarren Park, and play dates in our homes. We can also have events for just the ladies, like moms night-out, movies, dinner, and anything else that looks like fun.”</p>
